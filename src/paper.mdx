## Abstract

The emergence of humanoid platforms has paved the path towards advanced manipulation research, but the barrier to entry remains prohibitively high—with commercial platforms often exceeding \$30,000. While the **XLeRobot** ecosystem offers open-source, 3D-printable designs that lower costs to under $1,000, these platforms typically rely on "tethered" architectures. 

In this report, we present **XLeRobot-Pro**: a comprehensive system integration that upgrades the chassis into a fully standalone agent. By embedding an **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** directly into the body and implementing a novel **Tri-Bus Power Topology**, we eliminate the need for external tethering while maintaining real-time vision-based policy performance.

## System Architecture

### Tri-Bus Power Topology
To prevent voltage sags during high-torque manipulation, we decoupled the power domains. The architecture isolates high-noise components (Wheels) from sensitive compute (Jetson).

### Mechanical Rigidity
We addressed mechanical "wobble" by transitioning from a Single-Shear Cantilever to a **Double-Shear (C-Bracket) Topology**.

## Mathematical Modeling

We model the worst-case aggregate load $I_{peak}$ as the summation of the saturation current of all active actuators:

$$
I_{peak} = \sum_{i=1}^{17} I_{stall, i} \approx 17 \times 2.7\text{A} = 45.9\text{A}
$$

To stay within the 10A fuse limit of the Anker SOLIX C300, we derive the current draw function $I(x, y)$ where $x$ is torque and $y$ is acceleration:

$$
I_{total} = N_{motors} \cdot \left[ \left(2.52 \cdot \frac{x}{1000}\right) + 0.18 + D(y) \right]
$$

## Experimental Evaluation

### Control Loop Frequency
Benchmarks show that the embedded architecture supports real-time vision-based policies with latency comparable to desktop-tethered setups.

| Component | RTX 3060 Laptop | Jetson Orin Nano |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Preprocessing | 4.71 ms (212 Hz) | 8.20 ms (122 Hz) |
| Policy Inference | 24.33 ms (41 Hz) | 32.10 ms (31 Hz) |
| **End-to-End** | **29.05 ms (34.4 Hz)** | **40.30 ms (24.8 Hz)** |

### "Golden Settings" for Stability
We established a firmware profile that strictly enforces safe operating limits to prevent hardware fuse trips.

| Part | Bus | Torque (0-1000) | Accel | Speed | Justification |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Arms** | A+B | **800** | 40 | 200 | Damping suppresses $I_{dynamic}$ spike |
| **Wheels** | C | **220** | 20 | 254 | Torque capped to 22% for USB-C |
| **Neck** | C | HOLD | -- | -- | Inhibited while driving |

## Project BOM
The total cost for the standalone agent remains democratized, significantly lower than commercial alternatives.

| Subsystem | Component | Cost (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Compute** | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super | $249.00 |
| **Actuation** | 17x Feetech STS-3215 Servos | $289.00 |
| **Power** | Anker Solix C300 DC | $149.99 |
| **Structure** | PLA Filament (3kg) | $45.00 |
| **Total** | **Standalone XLeRobot-Pro** | **~$733.00** |
