title: Camera Not Detected
description: Fix for when USB cameras are not showing up as video devices.
---

## Symptoms

- `ls /dev/video*` shows no entries or fewer cameras than expected
- `cv2.VideoCapture()` returns `False` for `ret`
- YOLO tracking script errors with "no camera found" or similar
- Camera LED is off even though it's plugged in

## Likely causes

1. **USB cable not fully seated** — loose connection or damaged cable
2. **USB hub not powered** — hub can't supply enough current for cameras
3. **Wrong device index** — camera is at a different `/dev/video*` path than the script expects
4. **Kernel driver issue** — camera module not loaded (rare on Ubuntu)

## Fix steps

### 1. Check physical connection

Unplug and replug the camera. Try a different USB port. Try without the USB hub (direct to PC) to isolate the issue.

### 2. Check device detection

```bash title="List video devices"
ls /dev/video*
```

You should see even-numbered entries (`/dev/video0`, `/dev/video2`, etc.) — one per camera. If you see none, the camera isn't detected at the OS level.

### 3. Check with v4l2

```bash title="List video devices with details"
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

This shows which cameras are connected and their device paths.

### 4. Test the camera directly

```bash title="Quick camera test"
python -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); ret, frame = cap.read(); print('OK' if ret else 'FAIL'); cap.release()"
```

If this fails, try incrementing the device index (0, 1, 2...) until you find the working camera.

### 5. Check USB power

If using a USB hub, make sure it's powered. Low-power hubs may not supply enough current for multiple cameras. Try connecting the camera directly to the PC.

## Verification

After fixing, confirm:

1. `ls /dev/video*` shows the expected number of devices
2. The Python camera test returns `OK` for each camera index
3. The YOLO tracking or teleoperation script runs without camera errors

## Prevention tips

- Use a **powered USB hub** when connecting multiple cameras
- Always use the **same USB ports** — device paths can change when you move cables
- Add a camera check to your startup routine before running control scripts
- Label USB cables to avoid confusion
