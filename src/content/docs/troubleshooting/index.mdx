Find your issue by symptom. Each article covers one problem with likely causes, fix steps, and verification.

## Motor issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix |
|---|---|---|
| No motors move | Power not connected | Check 12V DC cable from battery to motor board |
| `Permission denied` on serial port | Port access restricted | `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0` |
| Motor count mismatch | Wrong port in script | Run `python lerobot/find_port.py` and update script |
| Single motor unresponsive | Wrong motor ID | Re-configure ID with Bambot |
| Arm jerks or moves wrong direction | Motor IDs swapped | Verify IDs match the [motor map](/docs/architecture/#motor-id-mapping) |
| Grinding noise from gears | Mechanical interference or damaged gear | Inspect servo horn alignment; replace servo if stripped |

## Camera issues

|---|---|---|
| [Camera not detected](/troubleshooting/camera-not-publishing/) | USB not connected or wrong device path | `ls /dev/video*` to check |

## Software issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix |
|---|---|---|
| Import errors after install | Missing dependencies | Reinstall with `pip install -e .` |
| Script can't find XLerobot files | Files not copied to correct LeRobot dirs | Check `/model`, `/robots`, `/example` folders |
| Joy-Con not pairing | `joycond` not installed or Bluetooth off | `sudo apt install joycond`, enable Bluetooth |

## Assembly issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix |
|---|---|---|
| Arm wobbles or has play | Loose servo horns or screws | Tighten servo horn screws; check bracket fit |
