description: Writing and formatting standards for XLerobot documentation.
---

These standards keep the docs consistent and usable. Follow them for all content contributions.

## Writing tone

- **Practical and direct** — say what to do and why
- **Explain why steps matter** — don't just list commands without context
- **Avoid "just" and "simply"** — if a step is non-trivial, acknowledge it
- **Define acronyms on first use** — e.g., "inverse kinematics (IK)"
- **Short paragraphs** — scan-friendly structure; no walls of text

## Commands

- Must be **copy-pasteable** — no placeholder syntax without explanation
- Include **exact command syntax**
- If placeholders are used, explain them immediately:

  ```bash title="Example with placeholder"
  python script.py --port /dev/ttyACM0  # Replace with your actual port
  ```

## Verification sections

Every setup guide and tutorial must include a **verification section** that describes:

- What success looks like
- Expected logs, screenshots, or behavior
- A quick-check command if possible

## "Tested on" block

Setup guides and tutorials should include:

- Date last tested
- Hardware used
- Software versions (OS, Python, LeRobot version, key packages)

Example:

> **Tested on:** Ubuntu 22.04, Python 3.10, LeRobot main branch (2025-01-15), STS3215 servos

## Linking conventions

- **Link to prerequisites** instead of assuming them
- **Link forward** to next steps at the end of every page
- **Link to troubleshooting** when mentioning things that can go wrong
- **Never duplicate setup instructions** — link to the canonical page instead

## Callouts

Use Starlight's built-in callout syntax:

- `:::note` — general information
- `:::tip` — helpful advice
- `:::caution` — something to be careful about
- `:::danger` — something that can cause damage or data loss

## Code blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language and title:

````md
```bash title="Start the dev server"
npm run dev
```
````

For shell output, use `title` to label what the output is from:

````md
```bash title="Expected output"
[server] started at http://localhost:4321
```
````

## Headings

- Use `##` (h2) for top-level sections within a page
- Use `###` (h3) for subsections
- Don't skip heading levels
- Keep headings short and descriptive

## Tables

Use tables for structured data (BOMs, command references, comparisons). Keep them simple — no merged cells or complex formatting.

## Images and media

- Place images in `src/content/docs/_assets/images/`
- Use descriptive filenames: `motor-id-config-bambot.png`, not `screenshot1.png`
- Add alt text describing what the image shows
- Use the `DemoClip` component for video with captions

## TODO markers

When information is missing, use explicit placeholders:

```
TODO(Rane): add tested ROS2 version
TODO(Rane): add screenshot of Bambot motor config
```

Never publish a page with critical information missing and no TODO marker.
