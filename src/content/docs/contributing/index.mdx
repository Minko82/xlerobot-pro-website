This site is built collaboratively. Whether you're writing docs, fixing errors, or adding tutorials, this section tells you how.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranegray/xlerobot-pro-website.git
   cd xlerobot-pro-website
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Create or edit content in `src/content/docs/` — all pages are MDX files.

4. Preview your changes in the browser at `http://localhost:4321`.

5. Submit a pull request.
