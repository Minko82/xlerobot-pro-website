title: Lab Notes
description: Dated engineering updates, progress logs, and lessons learned.

Lab notes are honest engineering updates. They document what was worked on, what changed, what broke, and what comes next — including rough edges and failures.

## Format

Each lab note follows a standard structure:

1. **Date + title** — when and what
2. **What I worked on** — scope of the session
3. **What changed** — concrete outcomes
4. **Problems found** — what went wrong or was unexpected
5. **Evidence** — photos, logs, screenshots, video clips
6. **Next step** — what to do next session
7. **Related docs** — links to relevant pages

## Why lab notes matter

- They create a **searchable history** of real engineering decisions
- They help collaborators **understand context** without asking
- They show **honest progress** — not just polished results
- They serve as **debugging breadcrumbs** when revisiting past problems

## Notes

No lab notes yet. As work progresses on the XLerobot build, notes will be added here in reverse chronological order.

TODO(Rane): Add first lab note when you start the build.
