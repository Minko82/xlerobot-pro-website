description: Control the robot arm to reach a target position using keyboard end-effector control.
---

## Outcome

You will move the robot arm's gripper to a specific position using keyboard input and inverse kinematics, confirming that the full control pipeline works.

## Concepts used

- End-effector control (vs. joint control)
- Analytical inverse kinematics
- Serial communication with servos

## Prerequisites

- [LeRobot installed](/docs/software/lerobot-install/) with XLerobot files in place
- Motors configured with correct IDs ([Calibration](/docs/calibration/))
- Basic joint control verified (`0_so100_keyboard_joint_control.py` works)

## Estimated time

10–15 minutes.

## Steps

### 1. Grant serial port access

```bash title="Linux only"
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
```

### 2. Run the end-effector control script

```bash title="Start end-effector control"
python 1_so100_keyboard_ee_control.py
```

### 3. Move the arm

Use the keyboard controls to move the end-effector in X, Y, and Z. The script translates your input into Cartesian targets, runs them through the IK solver, and sends joint positions to the servos.

### 4. Reach a target

Place an object (a cup, a bottle, or a small box) on the table in front of the robot. Use keyboard input to guide the gripper to the object.

### 5. Verify accuracy

Check that the gripper arrives at the expected position. If the arm consistently overshoots or undershoots, see the [IK calibration section](/docs/calibration/#ik-calibration).

## Expected output

- The arm moves smoothly in response to keyboard input
- The gripper reaches the target object within ~1–2 cm accuracy
- No servo errors or disconnections during movement

:::tip
If the arm jerks or moves in unexpected directions, the most common cause is a motor ID mismatch. Go back to [motor configuration](/docs/calibration/) and verify IDs.

## Why this matters

End-effector control is the foundation for everything that follows — teleoperation, vision-guided reaching, and autonomous policy execution all command the arm in Cartesian space via IK. If this works, your control pipeline is solid.
