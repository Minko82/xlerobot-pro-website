description: Outcome-based tutorials for XLerobot, from first motor test to policy training.
---

Tutorials are hands-on walkthroughs that guide you to a specific outcome. Each tutorial lists prerequisites, estimated time, and expected output so you know when you've succeeded.

## Suggested order

Follow these in sequence for the smoothest learning path:

| # | Tutorial | Outcome | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [First Reach](/tutorials/first-reach/) | Keyboard-control an arm to a target position | LeRobot installed, motors configured |

## Planned tutorials

The following tutorials are in progress:

- **Dual-arm coordination** — control both arms simultaneously
- **YOLO object tracking** — camera-guided arm following
- **Record and replay** — collect teleoperation demonstrations
- **Train ACT policy** — imitation learning from demonstrations
- **Sim-to-real transfer** — train in MuJoCo, deploy on hardware

:::tip
You don't need to complete all tutorials in order. Once you have basic joint control working ([Learning Path](/start-here/learning-path/) step 6), you can jump to any tutorial whose prerequisites you meet.

## Tutorial format

Every tutorial follows the same structure:

1. **Outcome** — what you'll achieve
2. **Concepts used** — what you'll learn
3. **Prerequisites** — what must be working first
4. **Estimated time** — how long it typically takes
5. **Steps** — the walkthrough
6. **Expected output** — what success looks like
7. **Why this matters** — context for the bigger picture
8. **Next tutorials** — where to go from here
