## About the project

XLerobot is an open-source, dual-arm mobile household robot built on the [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) framework. It combines affordable hardware (~$660 USD) with modern AI capabilities — teleoperation, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and vision-language-action models.

This site is the practical operator manual: tested workflows, golden-path guides, and honest engineering notes.
