## What is XLerobot?

XLerobot is an open-source, dual-arm mobile household robot built on top of the [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) framework by Hugging Face. The goal is to bring embodied AI to everyone at an affordable price point.

The platform combines:

- **Two SO-100/SO-101 robotic arms** for bimanual manipulation
- **A mobile base** built on an IKEA RÅSKOG cart with omnidirectional wheels
- **Multiple camera options** (RGB, stereo RGB, or Intel RealSense RGBD)
- **The LeRobot software stack** for teleoperation, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning

A basic setup starts at around **$660 USD**. The hardware is 90% 3D-printed, uses affordable servos, and can be assembled in under 4 hours.

## What can it do?

- Keyboard, Xbox controller, Switch Joy-Con, and VR teleoperation
- Vision-based object tracking (YOLO)
- Autonomous LLM agent control
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) training (ACT, SmolVLA, pi0.5)
- Reinforcement learning in MuJoCo simulation
- Dual-arm coordination

## Who is this site for?

### Builders and students

You want to build the robot, get it running, and learn from it. This site gives you setup guides, hardware BOMs, tested commands, and troubleshooting help.

### Engineers, recruiters, and collaborators

You want to understand the engineering decisions, see real progress, and evaluate technical depth. The lab notes and architecture docs are for you.

### Contributors

You want to help build docs, tutorials, or the site itself. The [contributing section](/contributing/) has templates, style guides, and review standards.

## How this site relates to upstream docs

The [official XLerobot docs](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) cover the upstream project — hardware design, software examples, and simulation.

This site is **not** a mirror. It is:

- The **integration layer** — how everything fits together in practice
- The **tested workflow** — commands verified on real hardware
- The **golden path** — the recommended sequence from unboxing to first autonomous task
- The **operator manual** — troubleshooting, calibration, and maintenance

When we link to upstream docs, we add local context: what to watch for, what we tested, and what broke.
