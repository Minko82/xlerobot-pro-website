Before starting the build, make sure you have the hardware, software, tools, and skills listed below.

## Hardware

### Required

| Component | Qty | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| STS3215 Servo (12V) | 17 | 12 for arms, 3 for base, 2 for head |
| IKEA RÅSKOG Cart | 1 | Similar carts work with minor base adjustments |
| Anker SOLIX C300 Power Station | 1 | Or equivalent — must supply ~120W across 2 ports |
| 4" Omni Wheels | 3 | VEX Robotics or equivalent |
| Motor Control Board | 2 | One per arm |
| USB-C to USB-A Cable | 2 | Connect motor boards to computer/Pi |
| USB-C Cable | 2 | Power delivery |
| Type-C to DC Cable (12V) | 2 | Power motor boards from battery |
| USB Hub | 1 | Anker or equivalent |
| 4ft 5264 Wires | 1 set | For extending motor cables |
| Table Clamps (4-pack) | 1 | Securing arm bases to cart |
| Hand Camera | 2 | Wrist-mounted RGB cameras |
| Logitech C920 | 1 | Head-mounted camera |

### Optional

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 | For untethered operation (not needed for basic setup — use your laptop) |
| Intel RealSense D415 | RGBD depth camera, replaces Logitech C920 |
| Stereo dual-eye RGB camera | Alternative to single head camera (+~$30) |
| Meta Quest 3/3S | For VR teleoperation |
| SO-100 arm set | For leader-follower teleoperation |

### 3D-printed parts

About 90% of the structural parts are 3D-printed. See the [upstream 3D printing guide](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/3d.html) for STL files and print settings.

## Software

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Ubuntu (recommended), macOS, or Windows with WSL |
| Python | 3.10+ (via conda or system) |
| Git | For cloning repos |
| Conda/Miniconda | Recommended for environment management |
| LeRobot | Installed via `pip install -e .` (editable mode) |
| Bambot | Motor configuration tool (Windows/Mac; Linux needs `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`) |

:::note
For the basic version of XLerobot, you don't need a Raspberry Pi. A laptop connected via USB is enough to get started.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| M3 screws/nuts set | General assembly |
| M4x10 screws (9x) | Wheel assembly |
| Flush cutter | Trimming 3D prints |
| Screwdriver set | Assembly |
| Needle-nose pliers | Cutting cart mesh for cable routing |
| Marker | Labeling motors and boards |

## Skills

You should be comfortable with:

- **Linux command line** — navigating directories, running scripts, editing config files
- **Basic Python** — reading and running scripts, installing packages
- **Basic electronics** — plugging in cables, identifying connectors, reading wiring diagrams
- **3D printing** (or access to a printer/service) — printing and post-processing parts

No prior robotics experience is required. The tutorials explain concepts like inverse kinematics, coordinate frames, and motor configuration as they come up.

## Cost estimate

| Configuration | Approximate cost (USD) |
|---|---|
| Basic (laptop, single RGB camera) | ~$660 |
| + Stereo dual-eye RGB | +$30 |
| + Raspberry Pi 5 | +$79 |
| + Intel RealSense D415 | +$220 |

Costs exclude 3D printing filament, tools, shipping, and taxes.

## Next step

Once you have the parts and tools ready, head to the [Learning Path](/start-here/learning-path/) for the recommended build sequence.
