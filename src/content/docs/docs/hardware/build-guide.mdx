title: Build Guide (3-Bus Draft)
description: Detailed print, assembly, wiring, and bring-up flow for an SO-101 + mobile base XLeRobot build using a 3-bus architecture.
sidebar:
  order: 2
---

This guide assumes an XLeRobot-style platform with:

- 2x [SO-101 follower arms](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101?assembly=Follower)
- Neck/head assembly
- Wheel base and cart
- NVIDIA Jetson mounted near the neck/base region

It consolidates print, assembly, wiring, and bring-up into a practical order, while pointing to official docs for part-specific procedures.

:::caution
This page documents a **3-bus draft architecture**. Some older pages still describe a shared/2-bus layout. For this build variant, follow this page.
:::

## Build overview

### What changed in this version

Use three independent motor buses:

| Bus | Subsystem |
|---|---|
| Bus 1 | Left arm |
| Bus 2 | Right arm |
| Bus 3 | Neck and wheel base |

This separation simplifies wiring, fault isolation, and motor debugging.

### Recommended build order

1. Print all parts
2. Assemble both SO-101 arms
3. Install wrist camera mounts and grippers
4. Assemble cart and wheel base
5. Assemble neck / top base / head
6. Configure motors (before final assembly)
7. Mount Jetson and route wiring
8. Final mechanical assembly and cable management
9. Software bring-up and bus verification

## 1) Print settings

Start from your baseline PrusaSlicer profile (or standard PLA profile), then only change the settings below.

XLeRobot notes that parts were printed on a consumer printer (for example, Bambu A1) with PLA, with orientation/support decisions handled in the slicer. PETG and CF variants are optional strength upgrades. See the [XLeRobot 3D printing guide](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/3d.html).

### General print notes

- Use PLA for first-pass prototyping and fit checks
- Prioritize part orientation for structural parts over cosmetic finish
- Dry filament in high humidity for cleaner fit-up and thread quality
- For soft finray-style fingers, use TPU95A

### Neck and wheel base

These parts are structural and should use stronger settings than cosmetic covers.

#### Layers and perimeters

- Perimeters (walls): 4
- Top/bottom solid layers: 5-6
- Layer height: 0.20 mm (or your normal quality preset)

#### Infill

- 25-35% gyroid (or cubic)
- Use 35% for base connector parts, motor mounts, and neck structural pieces

:::note
XLeRobot calls out that the wheel-base connector may need **Z scaling only** to balance load across omni-wheels and cart wheels.
:::

### Arms

SO-101 links and joint housings need strength plus dimensional accuracy.

#### Layers and perimeters

- Perimeters (walls): 4
- Top/bottom solid layers: 5
- Layer height: 0.16-0.20 mm
- Use 0.16 mm where fit/alignment is more sensitive

#### Infill

- 20-30% gyroid
- Use 30% for joint housings, base/shoulder parts, and clamp/camera-mount-adjacent parts

#### Arm-specific notes

- Print two **follower** arms for the XLeRobot dual-arm build
- Leader arm builds are only needed for leader-follower teleop workflows
- Include the [SO-101 wrist camera mount](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/SO101_Wrist_Cam_Hex-Nut_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module) and preferred gripper variant in the same print batch

## 2) Assembly

### A) Cart

Follow the IKEA cart instructions first to establish the rolling structure.

Practical tip:
- Do not finalize cable routing through the cart yet
- Leave access for motor extensions, USB data, power, and camera cable routes

### B) Arms (joints 1-5)

Follow the [official SO-101 follower assembly flow](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101?assembly=Follower) for both arms.

Wrist camera and gripper order:
1. Before attaching the gripper to joint 5, install the wrist camera attachment to the gripper
2. Install the gripper claw/fingers
3. Use the follower gripper approach on both arms

Use the [SO-101 wrist camera mount reference](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/SO101_Wrist_Cam_Hex-Nut_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module). This order avoids reopening the wrist stack later.

### C) Neck (top base and head)

Use the XLeRobot [arm-base assembly section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#arm-base):

- Top Base Assembly
- Head Assembly

The head assembly follows the same motor style and is derived from early SO-101 link patterns.

### D) Wheels and wheel base

Follow the XLeRobot [wheel-base assembly section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#wheel-base).

Key notes:

- Keep omni-wheel orientation/order exactly as documented
- Use motor cable extensions (do not rely on short direct runs)
- Leave slack until top-plate routing is finalized
- Mount top plate and connectors only after route checks

## 3) Motor configuration (before final assembly)

Configure motors before final cable management and hard mounting.

### A) Arm motors (SO-101)

Use the [LeRobot SO-101 motor configuration flow](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101#configure-the-motors):

1. Identify each MotorBus serial port (`python lerobot/find_port.py`) using [Quick Reference](/docs/reference/)
2. Configure motors one at a time
3. Set IDs and baudrate
4. Repeat for both follower arms

Many motors ship with default ID 1, so ID assignment must be unique per bus and baudrate must match board plus motors.

### B) Neck and wheel motors (Bus 3)

Use the XLeRobot [configure motors section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#configure-motors) for non-arm motors.

Notes:

- XLeRobot uses Bambot for head/wheel configuration
- On Linux you may need serial permissions (for example `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`)

### ID planning for 3-bus architecture

Use IDs by bus:

| Bus | Recommended IDs |
|---|---|
| Bus 1 - Left arm | 1-6 (SO-101 follower mapping) |
| Bus 2 - Right arm | 1-6 (same mapping; valid because bus is separate) |
| Bus 3 - Neck and wheels | 7-11 (example: 7-8 neck, 9-11 wheels) |

Strong recommendation: physically label motors and cables:

- `L-1` ... `L-6`
- `R-1` ... `R-6`
- `B-7` ... `B-11`

## 4) NVIDIA Jetson placement

Mount the Jetson at the base of the neck or in the center storage shell area, depending on your printed configuration.

Placement goals:

- Keep mass low for stability
- Keep USB ports accessible
- Minimize cable length to the three motor control boards, two wrist cameras, one head camera, and power distribution

TODO: insert Jetson placement image.

## 5) Wiring setup (3-bus)

Use the XLeRobot [wiring section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#wiring) as the baseline, applied to the 3-bus layout in this page.

Scope for this build document:

- Motor cables
- Power cables
- Camera cables

### A) Motor wiring (3 buses)

Bus 1 - Left arm:

- One controller dedicated to left arm
- Daisy-chain follower arm motors per standard layout
- Controller output to first motor in chain (joint 1 / shoulder pan)

Bus 2 - Right arm:

- One controller dedicated to right arm
- Same layout as left arm

Bus 3 - Neck and wheel base:

- One controller dedicated to neck and wheel motors
- Use extensions for clean routing from lower wheel plate to upper electronics

Cable routing tips:

- Leave service slack near each joint, especially wrist/gripper
- Avoid tight bends near motor connectors
- Keep motion cables away from pinch points
- Label both ends of each extension

### B) Power wiring

Status: in progress. Recommended structure:

- Battery mounted low and upright in the cart
- Main power line routed to a distribution point
- Separate fused outputs for left arm bus, right arm bus, neck/wheel bus, and Jetson power path (if using a separate converter/regulator)
- Add strain relief at battery and distribution points

### C) Camera wiring

Wrist cameras (x2):

- Route each cable along its arm with full-motion slack
- Secure cable at intervals (Velcro, sleeve, clips)
- Keep compute-end connectors accessible

Head camera:

- Route through the hollow neck
- Leave pan/tilt slack at the head joint

## 6) Final assembly

Follow the XLeRobot [final assembly section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#final-assembly), substituting Jetson where older instructions reference Raspberry Pi.

Final assembly notes:

- Complete wiring and cable management before clamping top base into the cart
- Clamp arms onto cart corners after route verification
- Do not push the fully assembled robot like a normal cart; lift to relocate to protect motor gears

Final checklist:

- All 3 buses configured and tested independently
- Motor IDs verified
- Motor directions verified
- Wrist cameras detected
- Head camera detected
- Jetson mounted securely
- Battery secured and upright
- No cable pinch points
- Full arm range without cable snagging
- Wheel base rotates freely

## 7) Bring-up checklist

Run these checks before full-stack teleoperation or training.

### Bus bring-up

Test one bus at a time:

- Bus 1 (left arm): ping/read all motors
- Bus 2 (right arm): ping/read all motors
- Bus 3 (neck/wheels): ping/read all motors

### Camera bring-up

- Wrist camera 1 stream verified
- Wrist camera 2 stream verified
- Head camera stream verified

### Motion sanity checks

- Arm joints move correctly
- Neck axes move correctly
- Wheels respond with expected direction
