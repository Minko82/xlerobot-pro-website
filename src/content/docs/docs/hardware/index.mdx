title: Hardware Overview
description: Physical specifications, design rationale, and component overview for XLerobot.
---

XLerobot is a dual-arm mobile robot built from affordable, widely available components. This page covers the physical system and why each component was chosen.

## System overview

| Spec | Value |
|---|---|
| Total weight | ~12 kg |
| Workspace height | 0.5–1.25 m above ground |
| Workspace reach | ~40 cm from cart edge (per arm) |
| Payload per arm | 600–1000 g |
| Mobility | 3 omnidirectional wheels |
| Power | Anker SOLIX C300 (288 Wh, 300 W max output) |
| Battery life | 10+ hours typical operation |

## Arms

Each arm is an SO-100 or [SO-101](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101?assembly=Follower) with 6 degrees of freedom, driven by STS3215 servos. Two arms are mounted at the front corners of the cart, giving the robot bimanual manipulation capability.

The system uses **17 servos total**: 12 for the two arms, 3 for the mobile base, and 2 for the head/neck.

:::note
The SO-101 is the newer revision. Both SO-100 and SO-101 are supported. If buying new, go with SO-101.

### Alternative servo

The STS3250 offers 1.5x the torque of the STS3215 at roughly 3x the price. Only needed if you plan to manipulate heavier objects.

## Mobile base

The base is built on an **IKEA RÅSKOG cart** with three 4" VEX omnidirectional wheels mounted underneath.

**Why the IKEA cart:**
- Available worldwide at a consistent price
- Sturdy metal construction with mesh shelves
- Right height for household surfaces (counters, tables, stovetops)
- Built-in storage on lower shelves for battery and electronics
- Easy to modify — drill, clamp, and route cables through the mesh

The wheels provide holonomic motion (forward, backward, sideways, and rotation) without needing to turn the base.

## Head

A 2-DOF head (pan + tilt) using 2 servos mounts a camera at the top of the robot. The design follows the XLeRobot [arm-base section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#arm-base). The hollow neck saves filament and provides a channel for cable management.

## Cameras

| Camera | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2x hand cameras (RGB) | Wrist-mounted on each arm | Low-cost USB cameras, using the [SO-101 wrist camera mount](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/SO101_Wrist_Cam_Hex-Nut_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module) |
| Logitech C920 | Head-mounted overview camera | Standard webcam, widely available |
| Intel RealSense D415 (optional) | RGBD depth camera | Replaces C920 for depth-based tasks |
| Stereo dual-eye RGB (optional) | Head-mounted stereo pair | +~$30, gives stereo vision |

## Power

The **Anker SOLIX C300** powers the entire system through its USB-C ports:
- 2x USB-C to DC (12V) cables power the motor control boards
- 1x USB-C to USB-C cable powers the Raspberry Pi (if used)

**Why this battery:**
- Three USB-C ports eliminate complex wiring
- 288 Wh capacity for 10+ hours of operation
- Fast charging: full charge in ~1 hour at 280 W input
- Built-in light, doubles as a portable backup power supply
- Solar panel compatible for outdoor use

**Alternatives:** Any portable power station that supplies 120 W+ across two USB-C fast-charging ports. Options include UGREEN and Anker portable chargers meeting this spec.

## 3D-printed parts

About 90% of the structural components are 3D-printed. The recommended setup:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Printer | BambuLab A1 (~$350–400 USD) or similar |
| Filament | PLA Matte Black (or PETG HF / PLA CF for strength) |
| Filament cost | $15–25 USD |
| Service printing | Under $50 USD total |

STL/3MF files are in the [XLerobot GitHub hardware directory](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot/tree/main/hardware). See the [upstream 3D printing guide](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/3d.html) for detailed print settings.

:::tip
Pre-dry PLA at 45°C for 8 hours if you're in a humid environment. Wet filament causes stringing and weak layer adhesion.

## Known limitations

- **Fixed height** — the cart height is not adjustable
- **Limited reach** — ~40 cm per arm from the cart edge
- **No in-hand dexterity** — simple gripper fingers, no fine manipulation
- **Payload** — 600–1000 g per arm; adequate for household objects, not heavy tools
