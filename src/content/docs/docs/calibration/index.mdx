Calibration ensures that motor IDs are correct, servos respond as expected, and the IK solver produces accurate movements.

## Motor ID configuration

Before first use, every servo must be assigned the correct ID using the **Bambot** application and/or the [LeRobot SO-101 motor configuration flow](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101#configure-the-motors).

For the 3-bus build variant, follow the [Build Guide (3-Bus Draft)](/docs/hardware/build-guide/) and the XLeRobot [configure motors section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#configure-motors).

### Procedure

1. Connect a single motor to a motor control board
2. Open Bambot (Windows/Mac, or Linux with `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`)
3. Navigate to the motor configuration page (use `python lerobot/find_port.py` from [Quick Reference](/docs/reference/) to confirm serial ports)
4. Set the motor ID according to the mapping below
5. Repeat for all 17 motors

### Motor ID map

| Motor IDs | Component |
|---|---|
| 1–6 | Left arm joints (shoulder to gripper) |
| 1–6 | Right arm joints (shoulder to gripper) |
| 7–8 | Head (pan, tilt) |
| 7–9 | Wheel base (3 wheels) |

:::note
This table reflects the shared-board mapping used in older setups. For the 3-bus draft layout (Bus 1 left arm, Bus 2 right arm, Bus 3 neck/wheels), use the [Build Guide (3-Bus Draft)](/docs/hardware/build-guide/).

:::tip
Label each motor with a marker after configuration. When wiring, you need to know which motor goes to which control board.

### Create motor sets

Group the configured motors into sets:
- **Left arm set**: IDs 1–6, connected to one motor control board
- **Right arm set**: IDs 1–6, connected to the other motor control board
- **Head set**: IDs 7–8, connected to one of the arm boards
- **Wheel set**: IDs 7–9, connected to one of the arm boards

## Verify motor response

After assembly and wiring, run the joint control test:

```bash title="Test all joints"
python 0_so100_keyboard_joint_control.py
```

Each joint should move in response to keyboard input. Check:

- All 6 joints on each arm respond
- Head pans and tilts
- All 3 wheels rotate
- No motors are skipped or reversed

If you are using the 3-bus architecture, also run the bus-by-bus checks in the [Build Guide (3-Bus Draft)](/docs/hardware/build-guide/).

## IK calibration

The analytical IK solver assumes standard SO-101 geometry. If your arm assembly has slight variations (loose joints, bent links), end-effector positioning may drift.

To verify IK accuracy:

1. Run `1_so100_keyboard_ee_control.py`
2. Command the arm to a known position
3. Visually confirm the gripper reaches the expected location
4. If consistently off, check for loose servo horns or bent brackets

:::note
There is no software calibration offset for the IK solver at this time. Accuracy depends on mechanical assembly quality.

## Camera verification

Verify each camera is detected as a USB video device:

```bash title="List video devices"
ls /dev/video*
```

You should see entries for each connected camera (typically `/dev/video0`, `/dev/video2`, `/dev/video4` — even-numbered devices).

To test a camera feed:

```bash title="Quick camera test"
python -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); ret, frame = cap.read(); print('OK' if ret else 'FAIL'); cap.release()"
```

For physical cable route checks, use the XLeRobot [wiring section](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html#wiring).
