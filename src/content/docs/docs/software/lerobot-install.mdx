title: Install LeRobot
description: Install the LeRobot framework and set up XLerobot files.
---

## Goal

Get LeRobot installed in editable mode and copy the XLerobot-specific files into the correct directories.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ with conda or miniconda
- Git
- Ubuntu (recommended), macOS, or Windows with WSL
- A working internet connection

## Steps

### 1. Install LeRobot

Follow the [official LeRobot installation guide](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot#installation) to set up the framework.

The recommended approach is to install in editable mode for easier file management:

```bash title="Clone and install LeRobot"
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Clone the XLerobot repository

```bash title="Clone XLerobot"
git clone https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot.git
```

### 3. Copy XLerobot files into LeRobot

Move the following files from the XLerobot repo into your LeRobot installation:

| Source (XLerobot) | Destination (LeRobot) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Analytical IK solver for SO-101 | `/model` folder | Inverse kinematics |
| XLerobot robot folder | `/robots` folder | Robot configuration |
| Example scripts | `/example` folder | Control and teleop scripts |

:::note
If you plan to use a Raspberry Pi, uncomment `xlerobot_host` and `xlerobot_client` in the LeRobot `__init__.py` file after copying files.
:::

### 4. Configure motors

Use the Bambot application to set motor IDs:

- **Arms**: Follow the SO-101 motor configuration guide
- **Head**: Set motor IDs to 7 and 8
- **Wheel base**: Set motor IDs to 7, 8, and 9

Mark each motor with a marker so you can identify which board it belongs to.

:::caution
On Linux, Bambot requires serial port access. Run `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0` before launching the application.
:::

## Verify it works

Run the basic joint control script to confirm motors respond:

```bash title="Test motor control"
python 0_so100_keyboard_joint_control.py
```

You should see each joint move in response to keyboard input. If nothing moves:

1. Check that the correct serial port is referenced in the script
2. Verify motor IDs match the expected configuration
3. Confirm power is connected to the motor control boards
4. Run `python lerobot/find_port.py` to check port detection

## Common issues

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Permission denied` on `/dev/ttyACM*` | Serial port not accessible | `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0` |
| Motor count mismatch | Port name wrong in script | Run `find_port.py`, update script |
| No motor movement | Power not connected | Check 12V DC cable from battery |
| Bambot won't launch (Linux) | Missing permissions | Grant serial port access first |

## Next step

Once motors respond to keyboard input, move on to [end-effector control and teleoperation](/docs/software/) or start the [first reach tutorial](/tutorials/first-reach/).
